# Requirements for Streamlit RAG Chatbot with Gemini API and ChromaDB

# --- Core Frameworks ---
streamlit

# Google Gemini API SDK
google-genai

# --- Vector Store and Dependencies (Optimized for Streamlit Cloud) ---
# NOTE: Using [hnsw] to enable fast indexing while avoiding dependency conflicts
# that brought in 'uvloop' (which broke TTS).
chromadb[hnsw]

# CRITICAL FIX for SQLite issues on Streamlit Cloud's Linux environment
pysqlite3-binary

# --- Embedding Model ---
# The model used by sentence-transformers for generating embeddings
sentence-transformers

# --- LangChain Ecosystem Components ---
# For document splitting and general utilities
langchain-text-splitters
langchain-core
langsmith

# --- Document Loaders/Parsers ---
# For various file types (PDF, Web Scraping, Data Files)
pypdf 
requests
pandas
beautifulsoup4
lxml

# --- Text-to-Speech (TTS) Fixes ---
# Used for generating voice responses (Edge-TTS)
gtts
edge-tts

# CRITICAL FIX: Allows async calls (like edge-tts) to run inside Streamlit's environment
nest-asyncio
